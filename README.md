# Basic Spring Security Implementation

This project is a CRUD web application built using **Spring Boot** and **Thymeleaf**, with a local SQL database. It has also been fully localised using **Spring Internationalisation** (English and Irish).

 The SQL file contains information on all the history of Eurovision song contests, including information such as location, venue name etc.

This database can be searched with various CRUD operations and parameters.
