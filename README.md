# Spring Boot CRUD Application

This project is a web application built using **Spring Boot** and **Thymeleaf/HTML**, with a H2 database. It has also been fully localised using **Spring Internationalisation** (English and Irish).

 The SQL file contains information on all the history of Eurovision song contests, including information such as location, venue name etc.

This database can be searched in various ways, and the information is presented neatly to the end user.
